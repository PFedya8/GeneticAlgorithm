# Genetic Algorithm

### Introduction
* Genetic Algorithm is a search based algorithm which is inspired by the process of natural selection.
* We have to find the best solution for a given problem.
* We have next function: f(x) := x * sin(x + 5) * cos(x - 6) * sin(x + 7) * cos (x - 8) * sin(x / 3);
* We have to find the extremum of this function.

### How it works?
* We have a population of individuals.
* At the beginning we have to generate a random population.
* Then we have to evaluate the fitness of each individual.
* And then we have to select the best individuals and create a new population.

### Configuration file
* config.gen
